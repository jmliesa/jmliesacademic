I am a Civil Engineer specialized in environmental engineering and sustainability (Technical University of Catalonia, UPC). During all my student and professional life I have been working in environmental engineering and industrial ecology fields. In the private sector, I worked for the public administration in Barcelona area and for private companies related with green infrastructures, water industries and civil engineering sector. I started this journey during my master thesis at the NTNU (Trondheim, Norway), assessing the water—energy—carbon nexus. I am currently a PhD candidate in the UPC (Barcelona, Catalonia) at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, assessing the energy and material flows of urban agricultre. During my PhD I had the opportunity to work with multidisplicary teams by closely collaborating with the Sostenipra research group in the Institute of Science and Technology (ICTA) in the Autonomus University of Barcelona (UAB). I also carried out my research with Newcaste University (Newcaste Upon Tyne, UK) and the Swiss center of excellence for agricultural research (Agroscope, Zurich, Switzerland).
